For running the serial file :
make clean
make all
./ising_serial

For the cuda files, i run them at google colab with adding %%cu at the top of the file 
and after running the following two commands: 

!pip install git+git://github.com/andreinechaev/nvcc4jupyter.git

%load_ext nvcc_plugin

Change L ,k and b manualy in each file. 
In v3 , make sure L is multiple of b.
